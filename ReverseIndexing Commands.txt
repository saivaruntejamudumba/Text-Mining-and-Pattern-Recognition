1.First we merge all the words in titles folder to one file 

 cat titles/*txt > inimerge.txt
 cat inimerge.txt|uniq > finmerge.txt
 awk '{ print $2 }' finmerge.txt > mergefinal.txt
 
2. Secondly we swap all the titles files in terms of words : freq

y=0
for entry in titles/*txt
do
 awk '{ print $2 " " $1 }' $entry > temp/$y.txt
 mv temp/$y.txt $entry
y=$((y+1))
done
 
This stores all the words in the titles folder as word:freq

3. Reverse Index
a.We need to first make an index of titles names to 0.txt, 1.txt ......
so we use this script to rename the titles with a prefix of the files such as 0.txt,1.txt........
indexscript.sh
n=0; for f in titlesindex/*.txt; do mv "$f" "$((n++)).txt_INDEX_OF_$f"; done

b. Then we need to transform the titles with word : freq as in titlesindex to out as 0.txt, 1.txt....

titlestransform.sh
y=0
for entry in /home/sm1264/varun/ReverseIndexing/titlesindex/*
do
        cat "$entry"  > /home/sm1264/varun/ReverseIndexing/out/$y.txt
          
	y=$((y+1))
done

c Now we search the files in out folder with the mergefinal text

cat mergefinal.txt | sort |uniq > mergesorted.txt
revindexmainscript.sh

for i in $(</home/sm1264/varun/ReverseIndexing/mergesorted.txt)
do
echo  "$i :" >> /home/sm1264/varun/ReverseIndexing/reverseindex3.txt
grep -rw  $i *| tr ":" " "|awk '{print $1 ":" $3}'|xargs|tr " " ":" >> /home/sm1264/varun/ReverseIndexing/reverseindex3.txt
done

index of 0.txt-->a.txt is given as

[sm1264@ci-lis-3lb2lq2 titlesindex]$ ls -1 | grep .txt > Indexes.txt

reverse index with 0.txt,1.txt is obtained in reverseindex3.txt
reverse index with titles names is obtained in reverseindexwithtitlename.txt
